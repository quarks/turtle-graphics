Turtle Graphics

V0.9.3
    new task added - move forward but with a "bend"

    color scheme conversion methods added (RGB <> HSL and RGB <> HWB)

    methods to produce CSS color style strings from numeric channel vales.
    

V0.9.2
    Line dash offset attribute added. See dash() method for details.
    
    Introduced new text alinment constants (LT, CT, RT, JT). The first
    three can be used as alternatives (not replacements) to the 'left', 
    'center' and 'right' values used in V0.9.1 so they can be used 
    interchangeably.

    These new constants enables full support for aligning text in the 
    new Turtle Text extension.
