Turtle Graphics

V0.9.1
    First release

V0.9.2
    Introduced new text alinment constants (LT, CT, RT, JT). The first
    three can be used as alternatives (not replacements) to the 'left', 
    'center' and 'right' values used in V0.9.1 so they can be used 
    interchangeably.

    These new constants enables full support for aligning text in the 
    new Turtle Text extension.
